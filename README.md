# The first and mighty Computer Service. Booted by Spring...Boot(?)

## !!Currently suspended indefinitely!! Please visit [Computer Service written in Node](https://github.com/bodetaima/computer.services.node) for backend details.

Maven is good. Gradle just made Maven even better. But still, Gradle

`./gradlew build`

Or for Windumbs *cough* Windows:

`./gradlew.bat build`

Or give it a break, use a f*cking IDE for f*cking Java's sake!

Or if you want to torment yourself, keep it with:

`./gradlew bootRun`

And add a .bat for Win...dows

That's it!

Oh, shoot! Check out the SQL directory, the SQL file is in there. And a hacking for Docker container, if you needed.

Have fun ruining your life with this Boot!
